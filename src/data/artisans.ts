    story: "Maria learned the ancient art of Zapotec weaving from her grandmother at the age of 8. Growing up in the mountains of Oaxaca, she was surrounded by the rich textile traditions of her ancestors. Her hands learned to work with cotton, wool, and natural dyes extracted from cochineal, indigo, and other native plants. Each piece she creates tells a story of her heritage, incorporating traditional patterns that have been passed down through generations. Maria believes that every thread carries the spirit of her people, and through her work, she keeps alive the cultural legacy of the Zapotec civilization. Her textiles are not just decorative items, but vessels of history and identity.",

    experience: "Master ceramicist specializing in authentic Talavera pottery for 30+ years",
    story: "Elena's hands have been shaping clay since she was a child, playing in her father's pottery workshop in Puebla. Born into a family of ceramic artists, she grew up surrounded by the ancient traditions of Talavera pottery, a craft that dates back to the 16th century. Elena spent her youth learning the meticulous 16-step process that creates authentic Talavera pieces - from preparing the special clay mixture to the final firing that brings out the brilliant cobalt blues and warm earth tones. Each piece she creates must meet the strict standards set by the Regulatory Council of Talavera, ensuring authenticity and quality. Her work bridges the gap between traditional techniques and contemporary design, creating pieces that honor the past while speaking to modern sensibilities. For Elena, pottery is meditation, cultural preservation, and artistic expression all rolled into one.",
